Your task is to extract all chemical-disease relations from a text in which the chemical/drug induces the disease. Note that the chemical or disease names should have appeared in the original input text.
The output should be saved as per the following format:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "chemical": "chemical1",
    "disease": "disease1"
  },
  {
    "chemical": "chemical2",
    "disease": "disease2"
  },
  ...
]
}
The output will be {'relations':[]} if there are no chemical-disease pairs in which the chemical induces the disease expressed in the input text.
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "chemical": "Lidocaine",
    "disease": "cardiac asystole"
  },
  {
    "gene": "daunorubicin",
    "disease": "neutropenia"
  }
]
}
