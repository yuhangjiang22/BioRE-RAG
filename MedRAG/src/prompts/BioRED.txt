Your task is to identify and extract pairwise relationships among the following entity types: "GeneOrGeneProduct", "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature", "ChemicalEntity", and "SequenceVariant". Each relationship should involve only two entities at a time. The detailed definitions for each entity type are provided as below: "GeneOrGeneProduct": For genes, proteins, mRNA and other gene products; "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature": For diseases, symptoms and some disease-related phenotypes; "ChemicalEntity": For chemicals and drugs; "SequenceVariant": For genomic/protein variants (including substitutions, deletions, insertions and others). Note that all entities should have appeared from the original input text.

Additionally, there are eight different types of nondirectional relationships annotated in the corpus: "Positive_Correlation", "Negative_Correlation", "Association", "Bind", "Cotreatment", "Drug_Interaction", "Comparison", and "Conversion". Relation types are valid for certain combinations of entity types as below:

"DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"-"ChemicalEntity" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Chemicals may induce diseases, increase disease risk, or their levels may correlate with disease risk.
"Negative_Correlation": Chemicals used as drugs may treat diseases or decrease disease susceptibility.
"Association": Captures relationships not clearly defined as positive or negative correlations, such as drugs with potential safety concerns.

"DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"-"GeneOrGeneProduct" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Overexpression or side effects of proteins (from genes) may cause diseases.
"Negative_Correlation": Proteins used as drugs may treat diseases or their absence may cause diseases.
"Association": Includes functional genes preventing diseases and other associations not falling under positive/negative correlations.

"DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature"-"SequenceVariant" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Variants may increase disease risk, contribute to disease susceptibility, or cause protein deficiencies leading to diseases.
"Negative_Correlation": Variants may decrease disease risk.
"Association": Includes variants associated with disease prevalence and those that cannot be categorized as causing the disease.

"GeneOrGeneProduct"-"GeneOrGeneProduct" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Genes may show positive correlations in expression or regulatory functions.
"Negative_Correlation": Genes may show negative correlations in expression or regulatory functions.
"Association": Modifications like phosphorylation or other associations that cannot be categorized differently.
"Bind": Physical interactions between proteins, including protein binding at gene promoters.

"GeneOrGeneProduct"-"ChemicalEntity" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Chemicals may cause higher gene expression or gene variants may trigger chemical adverse effects.
"Negative_Correlation": Chemicals may cause lower gene expression or gene variants may confer resistance to chemicals.
"Association": Non-specific associations and binding interactions between chemicals and gene promoters.

"ChemicalEntity"-"ChemicalEntity" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": One chemical may increase the sensitivity or effectiveness of another.
"Negative_Correlation": One chemical may decrease the sensitivity or side effects of another.
"Association": Includes chemical conversions and non-specific associations.
"Drug_Interaction": Pharmacodynamic interactions between chemicals or drugs.
"Cotreatment": Combination therapy using multiple chemicals.
"Conversion": One chemical converting to another.

"ChemicalEntity"-"SequenceVariant" Relations:
"Positive_Correlation": Chemicals may cause higher expression of a gene variant or increase sensitivity due to a variant.
"Negative_Correlation": Chemicals may decrease gene expression due to a variant or the variant may confer resistance.
"Association": Captures relationships not defined as positive/negative correlations, like variants on chemical binding sites.

The output triples should be saved as per the following format:
{'relations':
[
  {
  "entity1": {
    "text": "text1",
    "entity_type": "entity_type1"
  },
  "entity2": {
    "text": "text2",
    "entity_type": "entity_type2"
  },
  "relation": "relation1"
  },
  ...
]
}
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "ChemicalEntity": "ouabain",
    "DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature": "arrhythmias",
    "relation": "Positive_Correlation"
  },
  {
    "ChemicalEntity": "aconitine",
    "GeneOrGeneProduct": "m(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor",
    "relation": "Association"
  }
]
}
