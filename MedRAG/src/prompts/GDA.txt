Your task is to extract all gene-disease associations from an input biomedical text. Note that the gene or disease names in the extracted associations should have appeared in the original input text.
The output should be saved as per the following format:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "gene": "gene1",
    "disease": "disease1",
  },
  {
    "gene": "gene2",
    "disease": "disease2",
  },
  ...
]
}
The output will be {'relations':[]} if there are no gene-disease associations expressed in the input text.
With this format, a hypothetical example output for a biomedical text could be the following:
{'relations':
[
  {
    "gene": "IL1A",
    "disease": "breast cancer",
  },
  {
    "gene": "IL1B",
    "disease": "breast cancer",
  },
  {
    "gene": "calpain-10",
    "disease": "type 2 diabetes",
  },
  {
    "gene": "calpain-10",
    "disease": "T2D",
  },
  {
    "gene": "endothelial nitric oxide synthase",
    "disease": "coronary artery disease",
  }
]
}
